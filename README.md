# hello-world
I have done it!  Taking my first steps to learn coding and web development. One, two, three.... Well done, me!
I am from a land of beautiful contrasting landscapes in southern Africa; where the the desert meets the sea. I am passionate about many things and like to push boundaries in all dimensions.  Books have always been my friend. I am a practitioner and teacher of yoga and tai chi.
